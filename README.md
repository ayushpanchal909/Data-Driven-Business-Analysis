### Data-Driven Business Analysis

In my data analysis project, I started by fetching data from a MySQL database. The information was stored in different tables including details about customers, markets, products, and transactions. After gathering the data, I went through a process of cleaning it up. This involved tasks like removing duplicate entries and getting rid of empty rows to ensure accuracy.

One challenge was dealing with different currencies, so I worked on converting them into a unified currency for consistency. With the cleaned data, I established connections between the tables, allowing me to create meaningful relationships among them.

For visualizing the data, I used various interactive charts. To highlight top customers, I employed bar charts displaying sales volume and quantity. Additionally, pie charts showcased sales distribution by customer type. Stacked bar charts gave insights into customer behavior over time. Lastly, line charts depicted the performance of top customers over the last two years.

This process of extracting, cleaning, and visualizing data was repeated for market analysis and product analysis, providing a comprehensive overview of trends and insights.

### Objective of Analysis

>What are the key contributors to sales among top customers, markets, and products, and how do they compare?

>How has the performance of top customers, markets, and products evolved over the last two years based on their sales trends?

>How do the transaction and sales distributions vary across customer types, product types, and market zones based on the stacked bar chart?

>What insights can be drawn from the pie charts representing sales volume distribution among customer types, market zones, and product types?
